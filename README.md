# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The `$in` operator, when used with an empty array, will always return an empty result set, even if the field in the documents exists. This is not intuitive behavior and can cause unexpected issues in applications.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code showcases the incorrect usage of the `$in` operator. The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` is expected to return all documents where the `field` exists. However, due to the empty array, it returns no results.

## Solution

To avoid this issue, you should handle the case where the input array is empty.  A simple solution involves checking if the array is empty before executing the query. If it is empty, modify the query to return all documents, or handle it appropriately based on your application's logic.
